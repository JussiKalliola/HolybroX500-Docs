#### Checklist before usage

List of things what should be checked everytime before using the device
- e.g., Clean lens with microfiber cloth
- e.g., Attach propellers, battery/fuel source, and insert SD card / lens filters

#### Service checklist after usage

Like all things with moving parts and electronics, regular or constant use causes wear and tear. For drones, itâ€™s advisable to implement a routine maintenance programme on a per-flight basis rather than set dates in the calendar.

- e.g., Take care of the essentials and clean dirt and from the chassis. 
- e.g., Use an anti static cloth, a compressed air cleaner and a light brush to keep the UAV in a shiny, out-of-the-box condition.

### Software

List of software required to use the robot. Mention if the software is custom-made and provide a link (if open access) where to access it and how to use it. If its not custom-made, then short description about the software, features and links where more information can be found.

Example: 


<details>
<summary><strong>PX4 Flight Stack</strong></summary>

PX4 autopilot is an open-source autopilot system oriented toward inexpensive autonomous aircraft. PX4 is capable of integrating with other autopilot software, such as the QGroundControl ground control station software, via the MAVLink (Micro Air Vehicle Communication) protocol.

<Strong>Supported features</strong>
- Support for multiple vehicle types, including fixed-wing aircraft, multicopters, helicopters, rovers, boats, and underwater vehicles
- Fully manual, partially assisted, and fully autonomous flight modes
- Vehicle stabilization
- Waypoint navigation
- Integration with position, speed, altitude, and rotation sensors
- Automatic triggering of cameras or external actuators

More information: [Documentation](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/) | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PX4_autopilot) | [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkrtSvera-xusjMtgMUe-HA) | [Github](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot)

#### <strong>Flight controller architecture</strong>

The diagram below provides a high level overview of a typical "simple" PX4 system based around a flight controller.

The hardware consists of
- Flight controller (running the PX4 flight stack). This often includes internal IMUs, compass and barometer.
- Motor ESCs connected to PWM outputs, DroneCAN (DroneCAN allows two-way communication, not single direction as shown) or some other bus.
- Sensors (GPS, compass, distance sensors, barometers, optical flow, barometers, ADSB transponders, etc.) connected via I2C, SPI, CAN, UART etc.
- Camera or other payload. Cameras can be connected to PWM outputs or via MAVLink.
- Telemetry radios for connecting to a ground station computer/software.
- RC Control System for manual control

The left hand side of the diagram shows the software stack, which is horizontally aligned (approximately) with the hardware parts of the diagram.

#### <strong>High-level Software Architecture</strong>

The diagram below provides a detailed overview of the building blocks of PX4. The top part of the diagram contains middleware blocks, while the lower section shows the components of the flight stack. The arrows show the information flow for the most important connections between the modules. In reality, there are many more connections than shown, and some data (e.g. for parameters) is accessed by most of the modules.

Modules communicate with each other through a publish-subscribe message bus named uORB.
